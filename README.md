Source code for my personal portfolio site, built using React, Tailwind, JavaScript and p5.

This is probably the first website I've coded since 1998, which is right around when css started to become a thing. In starting this project, I decided to try out different options for css and figure out what works best for me.

What you're looking at now is version 3 of my portfolio. I started it using React / css, but felt stuff didn't look how I wanted it to. Then I redid it using sass, which looked fine, but still didn't seem right. 

Then I finally decided to try Tailwind. Honestly, I didn't like Tailwind at first, it seemed just like 1998-style in-line styling ... but I kept with my goal of finishing the project using each different technology and ended up really falling in love with Tailwind. I get now, it's just really fast to build things this way.

Pages and Components are all .jsx files, and the ball animation is a Processing sketch written using p5 and in the project as a .js file. Seems like there's lots of different ways to structure React projects, IMHO it seems kinda logical to break things up this way. 

Speaking as someone who coded a lot, then took a big break ... I gotta say, it really is a lot of fun making stuff now. Between all the 3rd party libraries, all the free help online and just how advanced JavaScript is, it really is a joy to build things. 

Back in 1996, I co-authored a book on JavaScript (https://www.amazon.com/Javascript-Example-Stephen-Feather/dp/0789708132/) and back then it was barely good for form validation. Now you can build who worlds with it. Far out.
